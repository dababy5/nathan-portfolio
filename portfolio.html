      <p>What?<br>Taking inspiration from the open-source Dingo Quadruped, I fully redesigned and modeled a quadruped robot. Creating my own remotely controlled dog.</p>
      <p>How?<br>By designing, printing and wiring
              my robot, I was able to learn critical
              skills in CAD, 3D printing, and
              electrical design. I worked with
              hobby servos as well as
              microcontrollers to create a working
              prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goals?<br>After finishing an initial prototype, I
plan on reprinting and optimizing
my design, as well as implementing
ROS2 to remotely control the
quadruped. Programming certain
walking and jumping motions using
inverse Kinematics

      UNDERWATER ROV: BURST

      <p>What?<br>As part of a UVA club, I created an
underwater remotely operated
vehicle (ROV) from scratch.
Starting from a CAD design to fully
operating electronics and motors. I
was personally responsible for the
frame and layout of the ROV while
also contributing to the electronic
assembly.</p>
        <p>How?<br>By leading the Structures and Safety Sub-team, I was able to work on and oversee the construction of the ROV applying my skills in circuitry, 3D design, robotic assembly and mechatronic engineering.</p>
        <p>Goals?<br>As the new Lead Engineer of my club, my goal is to participate and succeed in the 2026 MATE ROVE Competition. For this, we will need to refine and improve upon our current submersible, adding water quality sensors and a robotic actuator to pick up and move the items under water</p>
